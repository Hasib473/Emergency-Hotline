3. What is **Event Bubbling** and how does it work?
  Ans: When we do something like click on a small element inside a bigger one, the action also happens on the bigger elements around it automatically.
   Basically its called Event Bubbling .
   When we click on the child element it first runs on that element, then automatically moves up to its parent, then grandparent, and so on, until it reaches the top of the page.
   
4. What is **Event Delegation** in JavaScript? Why is it useful?
 Ans : Event Delegation is when we put an event listener on a parent element instead of many child elements. The parent handles events for its children automatically.
      Its useful because
       (i) we donâ€™t need to add listeners to every child.
       (ii) Works even for new elements added later.
   
5. What is the difference between **preventDefault() and stopPropagation()** methods?
  Ans:  preventDefault() stops the default action of an element
        stopPropagation() stops the event from bubbling up or down in the DOM
